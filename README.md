WolkenWelten aspires to be the **open voxel sandbox** you can modify while it's running.

To accomplish this it combines a **custom graphics engine** written in **Rust** with the **V8 JavaScript engine**.
This should allow for a workflow similar to a browsers DevTools, but with voxels.

Everything is still **very experimental**, and it's more of a proof of concept rather than a finished game.

During development focus has been put into supporting low-end devices like the **Raspberry pi 4(00)**, because of that it should run at ~60FPS in 720p, and ~30-40 in 1080p.

If you want to chat, have a question or would like to contribute then the most direct way would be either Matrix or Discord.

# How to build it
You need a complete rust toolchain installed that supports Rust 2021 (1.56+), for example via `rustup`.
After that executing the `cargo run --release` command should build and run the game.

## Linux
In addition to a Rust toolchain, you need to install a couple of system header files using your distributions package manager:

### Arch Linux
```sh
pacman -S base-devel alsa-lib fontconfig freetype2
```

### Debian / Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS
```sh
apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev
```
